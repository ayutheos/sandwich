The most delicious sandwich I had was a homemade sandwich that I made in Leeds.
It had humus and turkey slices. Oddly, I would have thought that my most
delicious sandwich must have cheese, but thinking back, humus is as good as
cheese.

The biggest most delicious sandwich I had was in Perth, where there was
aubergine, alfalfa sprouts, red and green peppers, grated cheddar cheese (Most
Important!), mushrooms and other yummy ingredients that I have forgotten.
